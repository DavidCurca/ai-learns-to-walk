# AI Learns To Walk
This is an AI I made that can walk a track

I used a genetic algorithm and a Feed Forward

Neural Network

You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/)

## Neural Network
I used a 4 Layers Feed Forward Neural Network.

There are 8 (The Lidar) Inputs and 3 outputs (Left, Right, No Action)

2 Hidden Layers with 6 neurons each

## To Do
- [X] Add Collision
- [X] Add Lidar
- [X] Encode Lidar Output
- [X] Add Individual NN
- [X] Add Genetic Algo
- [X] Add Better Genetic Algo
- [X] Fix Lidar
- [X] Add Loading/Saving Genetic Model

## Installation
`pip install pygame`

`pip install torch===1.5.1 torchvision===0.6.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`
